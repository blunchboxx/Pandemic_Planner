__Welcome to the Pandemic Planner!__


__About:__

__Using the Pandemic Planner:__

- _The Pandemic Planner uses Crow for the connection between the frontend and the backend. It can be downloaded and set up from this website: https://crowcpp.org/master/getting_started/setup/windows/_

- _The Pandemic Planner repository has all the required parts for it to be properly built and executed. So go ahead and clone the repository into your directory of choice._

- _Once the project files and Crow are properly connected, the Pandemic Planner can be executed and you can begin using the program._

- _While the Pandemic Planner is executing, you will need to navigate to: http://localhost:8080/home in your web browser of choice._

- _Once there you can interact with the frontend and enjoy the Pandemic Planner in action!_


__Happy Planning!__
